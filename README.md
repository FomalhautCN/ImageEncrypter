# ImageEncrypter
A basic Java program which encrypts or decrypts any file to a png file or vice versa.
To use, simply build the source code into a jar file and run it with the following syntax:
-enc <input file> <output file>     //Encrypts the input file and saves it to the output file as a .png file.
-dec <input file> <output folder>   //Decrypts the input .png file and saves it into the designated folder. Since the encryption                                       process considers file name, the file name and extension are conserved.
